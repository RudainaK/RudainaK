## Hi there!

### About me

I'm a computer engineering student at the University of Toronto. My interests are in both hardware and software, which is a big focus in my choice of classes. I'm a part of UTAT Space Systems Firmware team, working on Finch. 

### Completed Projects

Just a quick disclaimer, due to academic integrity regulations, I cannot share school related code on github. However, I am happy to discuss my code with anyone interested. 

#### Pong Remake (2nd Year Computer Organization Course)

My partner and I wrote a program that would utilize a VGA display for a Pong Game. It has both 1 to 2 player modes, and with a bonus sub mode that allows for 2 balls. Written in C. 

#### GIS Software (2nd year Communications and Design Course)

I, along with two teammates, spent the semester developing a mapper software using OpenStreetMap data. The project included using two APIs and writing pathfinding algorithms to create a useable and responsive software. By far one of my favorite projects. Written in C++. 

### Shorter Scripts 

These are small scripts I made for practice and for fun

#### Conway's Game of Life

I recreated Conway's Game of Life in python using Pygame

#### Rubiks Scrambler 

Written in C, I wrote a short script that would generate a scramble for a Rubiks cube, similar to one's you find on other sites 

#### Fractals PPM 

A script that generates different fractals depending on the equation 

### Work in Progress

#### Rubiks Solver 

A C++ program that can generate both scrambles and solves. Written in C++. 

#### Discord PC Part Alert Bot 

Currently being updated, using asyncpraw, I wrote a bot that updates the user about parts of interest on the /r/bapcsalescanada subreddit. A small aid in the face of the GPU shortage.
